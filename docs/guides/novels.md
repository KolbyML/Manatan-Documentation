# Novels (EPUB)

Import EPUB files, read with fast lookups, and optionally sync progress.

## 1) Import EPUB files

1. Open the Novels/EPUB section in the Web UI.
2. Click **Import EPUB** (or drag and drop files).
3. Open a book and start reading.

> **Tip:** standard non-encrypted EPUB files work best.

## 2) Reading tips

- Use your preferred dictionary workflow for quick lookups.
- If parsing feels off, check [Getting started](/docs/guides/getting-started) for parsing recommendations.

## 3) Sync across devices (optional)

Sync is optional. If enabled, reading progress can stay in sync across devices.

Manatan is local-first and works offline if you keep sync disabled.
