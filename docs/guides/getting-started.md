# Getting started

Install Manatan, open the Web UI, then choose what you want to immerse with.

## 1) Download and install

2. Run the Manatan app for your platform.
3. In the launcher, click **Open Web UI** (or open the URL manually).

```text

```

> **Tip:** first launch can take around 30 seconds.

## 2) Install extensions and add sources

1. Open the Web UI and go to **Browse**.
2. Open **Extensions** and install what you need.
3. Open **Sources**, choose a source, and start browsing.

> **Security note:** extension repositories are often third-party. Only install what you trust.

## 3) Pick a mode

### Manga

Read from sources or local files.

- Next: [Local manga](/docs/guides/local-manga)

### Anime

Watch from sources or local files.

- Next: [Local anime](/docs/guides/local-anime)

### Novels (EPUB)

Import EPUB files and read with quick lookups.

- Next: [Novels (EPUB)](/docs/guides/novels)

## Optional: better lookup parsing

If you use Yomitan, set sentence termination to a custom mode that does not split on new lines.
