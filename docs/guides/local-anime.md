# Local anime

Manatan can play anime stored locally on your device.

## 1) Set your local anime folder

1. Open **Settings** > **Browse**.
2. Set **Local anime source location**.
3. Open the Local anime source and pick a show.

If you add episodes later, refresh the episode list.

## 2) Supported folder structure

Use one folder per series, with video files directly inside.

```text
[Local anime folder]/
  My Anime Title/
    cover.jpg
    ep01.mp4
    ep02.mkv
```

Common formats are `.mp4` and `.mkv`.

## Tips

### Stable ordering

Use naming like `ep01`, `ep02`, `ep10`.

### Custom cover image

Add a `cover.jpg` file in the series folder.

### Android gallery cleanup

Create an empty `.nomedia` file to hide videos/covers from gallery apps.
